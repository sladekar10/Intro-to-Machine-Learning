    "### List Comprehension\n",
    "One useful concept that Python allows for is list comprehension. List comprehension allows us to create lists from other lists or iterable objects in **one line of code**. List comprehension can also be thought of as a one line `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic outline for list comprehension is as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[expression for item in list]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here the `[]` brackets indicate list comprehension and our output will be a list, `expression` represents code that will run and its output will be stored in our list, and `for item in list` loops through each item in the iterable object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's test list comprehension by creating a list that contains the numbers 1-10. Recall that `range(1,11)` creates a sequence of numbers. These numbers are given in the form of a Python [generator](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/) that we loop over. (Recall, a generator creates the numbers on the fly instead of creating them all at once and filling up memory.)"

For those interested, see this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34142485/difference-between-numpy-dot-and-python-3-5-matrix-multiplication) on the differences between the methods.

    "Broadcasting is an implicit functionality of NumPy to allow arithmetic between arrays of different dimensions or shapes. This is a functionality you will be aware of as it will naturally arise in your code and can potentially cause you headaches if you don't know how it works! Below are the three general rules that broadcasting follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Rule 1: If the two arrays differ in their number of dimensions, the shape of the one with fewer dimensions has its shape padded with ones on its leading (left) side.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Rule 2: If the shape of the two arrays does not match in any dimension, the array with shape equal to 1 in that dimension is stretched to match the other shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Rule 3: If in any dimension sizes disagree and neither is equal to 1, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these rules, let's take a deeper look at what they are actually saying. We are going to reproduce the examples given in the image below and step through them and see how each rule applies to each example. Lastly, note that idea of braodcasting is not limited to the addition operation!\n",

    "Let's start off by converting the definition of the dot product into code! Complete this TODO by creating a class called `CosineSimilarity` which computes the cosine similarity (angle between two vectors) between any two vectors. You are **NOT** allowed to use any existing libraries to compute the angle, however you can use NumPy to compute the square root, arccos, and to convert your radians to degrees.\n",

    "1. Create the `CosineSimilarity` by following the below instructions:\n",
    "    1. Define the class `CosineSimilarity` using the `class` keyword. \n",
    "    2. Define the `__init__()` method which takes in three arguments `self`, `x`, and `z` and saves them as class variables. These two arguments will be the vectors in which the cosine similarity will be computed.\n",
    "    3. Define a method called `compute_angle()` that takes in no arguments other than `self` (remember `self` is a required argument for methods).\n",
    "    4. Within the `compute_angle()` method compute the angle between two vectors and return the answer in __degrees__.  Use the following equation to compute the angle between two vector.\n",
    "    $$ \\theta = \\text{arccos}(\\frac{\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{z}}{||\\mathbf{x}||_2 ||\\mathbf{z}||_2})\n",

    "    $$\n",
    "    where a vector dotted with itself is the same as squaring the vector.\n",
    "        2. Hint 2: Use `np.sqrt()` to compute the square root and `np.arccos()` to compute arccos.\n",
    "        3. Hint 3: The output of `np.arccos()` is in radians! **Be sure** to use `np.degrees()` to convert your output into degrees. If you don't do this you will fail the test.\n",
    "        4. Hint 4: Due to rounding errors your answer should be close to ~180 degrees."

    "Next, let's review what [normal or Gaussian distribution](https://machinelearningmastery.com/statistical-data-distributions/) is while also practicing some equation to code conversion. Now this weeks math review didn't mention normal distributions but we did lightly cover probability distributions. Recall **a probability distribution is a list of outcomes and their associated probabilities**. Meaning, **a distribution is simply a collection of values or frequencies for a given observation**, like age of a population. A normal distribution is a specific type of probability distribution which looks like the following.\n",

    "\n",
    "Further recall a normal distribution has the parameters $\\mu$ (referred to as mu) which represents the mean and $\\sigma$ (referred to as sigma) represents the standard deviation. Throughout the semester we'll frequently make the assumption that our data is normally distributed. This is because many natural phenomena are like age, height, test-scores, IQ scores, sum of the rolls of two dices and so on follow normal distributions, thus making such an assumption reasonable. As normal distributions are found in so many different places they are one of the important probability distribution in statistics and machine learning!\n",

    "For this TODO let's convert the normal distribution equation to code and plot what a normal distribution looks like using Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a function called `gaussian()` that takes in the arguments `x`, `mu`, and `sig`. Convert the above normal equation into code and return the output of the equation. Recall that `mu` represents $\\mu$ and `sig` represents $\\sigma$.\n",
    "2. Use the NumPy function `np.linspace()` ([docs](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html)) to generate an array of 120 numbers between -4 and 4. Pass the arguments -4, 4, and 120 to do so. Store the output into the variable `x_values`.\n",
    "3. Call the `gaussian()` function that receives `x_values`, `mu`, and `sig`. Store the output into the variable `y_values`.\n",
    "5. Plot the `x_values` and `y_values` using Matplotlib `plt.plot()` function. You should see a normal distribution being plotted like in the above image!\n"
