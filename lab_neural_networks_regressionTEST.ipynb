We'll do so by, once again, working with the Forest Fire dataset as we have already performed data exploration and preparation so that we can get to implementing neural networks more quickly.\n",

It might be useful to duplicate all the `TODO` cells so you can try to match the correct output with your own code!**\n",

        "\n",
        "Recall that a neural network is made of neurons. The structure of a neuron is given by the below image. \n",

        "The 4 basics steps all neurons utilize are given as follows:\n",
        "1. First, each neuron takes input from every neuron in the previous layer represented by $x$ or $a$. The 1st hidden layer always takes in the data $x$ as input.\n",
        "2. Next, each input is assigned a weight just like we have seen in previous algorithms. For clarity sack, we will keep the bias separate from the weights even though they can be combined as we have done in the past. Using the weights, a linear combination can be taken between the weights and inputs where the bias is also added such that we get the following: $z = \\wv^\\top \\xv + b$. Recall $z$ represents the continuous output of a neuron (i.e., the output after the linear combination of inputs). This linear combination of inputs is nothing new, we have seen this time and time again with linear regression and classification algorithms alike.\n",
        "3. Next, an activation function $g(\\cdot)$is applied to $z$ producing the  neuron output $a$ where $a = g(z)$. The activation function is often picked to be a non-linear function. We do this in order to convert our equation from a linear equation to a non-linear equation (more on this later). \n",
        "4. Finally, after applying the activation function, the output $a$ is passed to the next layer and acts as the inputs for the next layer. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Layers**\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, recall that a neuron network can stack multiple neurons to create layers. For a basic 2 layer neural network there are two main layers: the hidden layer and the output layer.\n",

        "**Input layer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The layer which takes in all the inputs of the data is referred to as the *input layer*. While this layer is not counted as an actual layer as it contains no neurons. It is often referred to as the input layer regardless. This layer is used to represent all the data features that will be input into the actual neural network. In other words, we can think of this layer as representing the input data as a matrix $\\Xm$ (multiple data samples) or a vector $\\xv$ (a single data sample) where each blue circle in the input layer image above can be thought of as a single feature in the data. Thus, the above data would have 3 features.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hidden layer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The first actual layer is called the *hidden layer*. The hidden layer acts as a intermediate layer between the input layer and output layers. A hidden layer is the 1st real layer in a neural network. The hidden layer contains neurons which are more specifically referred to as *hidden neurons*, also known as *hidden units*. This is partly done to differentiate the hidden neurons from the output neurons. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Output layer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The second and last layer is called the *output layer*. The output layer contains neurons which produce the outputs of the neural network. In other words, the output layer is responsible for computing the predictions $\\hat{y}$. \n"

        "Let's try training our `NeuralNetwork` class. The goal for the this TODO will be to get your validation MSE below 2. To do so, you'll have to manually tune the hyper-parameters such as the number of hidden units `hidden_neurons`, which activation function you'll use for `g_hidden` (`Sigmoid` or `Tanh`), the learning rate `alpha`, the size of the mini-batches `batch_size`, and the number of epochs `epochs`.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Call the `data_prep()` so that it will return the Forest Fire regression data formatted as NumPy arrays. Do so by passing the arguments which correspond to the following:\n",
        "    1. Pass any required arguments (i.e., arguments with no default values).\n",
        "    1. Return all data as NumPy arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Create an instance of the `NeuralNetwork` class. Store the output into `nn`. In order to pass the TODO check you will need to tune the hyper-parameters (i.e., arguments passed to the  `NeuralNetwork` class) such that you get a validation MSE score below 2. Thus, you need to determine which arguments to pass to the `NeuralNetwork` class. The only argument that should remain static is the `g_output` argument. Recall, this will always need to be set to the `Linear` class for regression problems.\n",
        "    1. Hint: Use the learning curve plot that is plotted at the end of the training to help select how many epochs you need. Refer to this [post](https://machinelearningmastery.com/learning-curves-for-diagnosing-machine-learning-model-performance/) or last weeks lab on how to interpret the training and validation learning curves."
